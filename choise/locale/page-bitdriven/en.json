It comprises well-established coins that have strong fundamental reasons for outstanding performance with a successful track record, that historically grew alongside Bitcoin after every halving yet significantly outperformed it.</p><p>The Bitdriven index token is not a token in the conventional sense, but rather an index value that is calculated in proportion to the growth of the entire portfolio.</p>"

			{
				"title": "Why does it take so long to get the expected return?",
				"description": "<p>The BitDriven strategy is tied to market cycles and Bitcoin halving: the portfolio consists of coins that historically show a high correlation with Bitcoin, yet fluctuate with a greater amplitude. Thus, there is every reason to expect that after spring 2024 halving of Bitcoin (and its growth on top of that) these coins will grow even more, allowing you to get the expected 12X return.</p><p>At the same time, since the amplitude of the coins’ price fluctuations is greater than that of Bitcoin, it can be assumed that they have fallen even more right now, therefore creating an attractive opportunity to buy on the dips.</p>"
