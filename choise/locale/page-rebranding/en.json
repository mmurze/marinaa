			"We are witnessing a new stage of development in crypto as a part of global finance, with the DeFi world becoming a prominent element of the crypto community’s daily life. The crypto world today is divided into two universes – centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), and we are working on connecting them to give people the choice to earn more on their crypto assets.",
			"When I launched Crypterium back in 2017, one of the main challenges was to connect traditional banking with the then new and unexplored blockchain technology. At the time I set the goal of creating a neobank for crypto. Make cryptocurrencies simpler for users – this was the main principle I was already following and promoting among other team members back then.",
			"Since 2017 we have been developing alongside the crypto market, solving the industry issues. We had our challenges and issues, and we were learning and improving our processes on the go. Now we have set the goal to create a MetaFi ecosystem, adding DeFi services to the neobank. Our mission has broadened - to not only make access to cryptocurrencies simpler and more convenient, but also to give users new ways to earn more.",
			"<strong>Choise.com - New Step In Our MetaFi Vision</strong>",
			"Today we are building Choise.com – a brand-new solution that connects CeFi and DeFi. It is an exciting step in the company's evolution. Not only are we ready to take part in creating DeFi, but also to bridge it with CeFi to give everyone the ability to achieve greater profits.",
			"We call Choise.com a MetaFi ecosystem, because we are gathering multiple solutions in a single marketplace to offer more opportunities to earn on crypto. New CeFi and DeFi products appear every day, but it is still a challenge for people to make use of them: one has to move between blockchains, platforms, wallets to access liquidity pools or multi-currency deposits. Choise.com will aggregate the most profitable crypto solutions of the industry, regardless of their complexity under one roof. We will make it possible for both crypto newbies and pros to find an interesting way to earn on crypto every single moment in one app.",
			"Everything that Choise.com does, all our developments going forward, is aimed at ensuring that any user has the ability to utilize the potential of their funds.",
			"The basis for Choise.com is the unique Charism platform that aggregates DeFi solutions and connects them with the CeFi infrastructure of Crypterium. Our priority is to offer you ways to gain income in DeFi as easily as flipping a light switch. By wrapping our centralized solutions around a whole suite of decentralized services, we can give everyone a return on their money by simply owning crypto.",
			"We handle the complicated inner workings ourselves, so all that is left for you is to set up an account and explore the many options that we offer.",
			"<strong>Your Choise to Earn More</strong>",
			"Choise.com is a unified entrance point into both CeFi and DeFi. Built upon years of experience gained working on Crypterium, our new brand embraces the path we have walked so far, as well as the future we are paving now while working on the Charism platform. This bridge between the two user bases will greatly simplify user exposure to DeFi products, making the process of working with them easy, reliable, and fool-proof.",
			"When we decided to connect the worlds of centralized and decentralized finance, I spent quite some time conceptualizing the new ecosystem. What is our mission? What benefit do we stand to bring to the crypto industry? I realized that we should follow our core principles - to keep making things simpler, so that anyone can have the chance to gain greater profits.",
			"We set before ourselves the goal of offering our users the most profitable and interesting opportunities to achieve income from CeFi and DeFi products alike. Farming, access to CEXs and DEXs, liquidity pools, decentralized derivatives, and many other features - all available under one roof and not requiring you to switch between multiple blockchains or applications.",
			"We have filmed a short video featuring the main functionalities of Choise.com, which explains the changes.",
			"<strong>Pursuing an Innovative Future Together</strong>",
			"As a founder and entrepreneur with many business ventures under my belt, I can say that building Choise.com is the most complex and challenging undertaking that I have ever tackled. Now I devote all my time to building our MetaFi ecosystem – as I often say among colleagues, this task is on par with rocket science, and we are accomplishing it every day.",
			"Building ambitious crypto projects is a tall task. But we always push forward and keep improving. We have survived the crypto winter of 2018 because we always prioritize quality and innovations, because we choose to work on our products and not just profit from temporary hype. And I am grateful to the team and our users who have been with us over these years.",
			"I am very excited about our future. And I would be happy to share this journey with you. Remember: everyone has the right and the choice to earn more.",
